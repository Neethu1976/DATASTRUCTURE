This repository contains C programs for various data structures and algorithms, implemented as part of my MCA 1st Semester. Programs include Binary Search Tree, Circular Queue, Doubly Linked List, Kruskal's Algorithm, Disjoint Set, and more. To run, clone the repository and compile each .c file using gcc. Contributions are welcome for improving or adding additional programs.
